# DSAmax

Welcome to the **DSAmax** repository! This repository will be serving a a collection of my journey through DSA. The goal is to document my learning process, practice various problems, and implement efficient solutions using different data structures and algorithms.

## Introduction

**DSAmax** is a personal project aimed at keeping track of my progress as I learn and master various data structures and algorithms. It includes code implementations, problem-solving approaches, and notes on each topic.

## Goals

- To gain a thorough understanding of fundamental and advanced data structures.
- To solve a wide range of algorithmic problems to enhance problem-solving skills.
- To document and maintain organized notes and code for future reference.
- To prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming.

## Contents

The repository is structured into different folders, each representing a category of data structures or algorithms:

- `HelloWorld/` : A must for all programmers üòÅ
- `Arrays/`: Implementations and problems related to arrays.
- `LinkedLists/`: Concepts, examples, and problems on linked lists.
- `Stacks/`: Code and notes on stack operations and applications.
- `Queues/`: Queue-related algorithms and problem-solving techniques.
- `Trees/`: Binary Trees, BSTs, AVL Trees, and other tree-related problems.
- `Graphs/`: Graph representations, traversal algorithms, and more.
- `Hashing/`: Hash tables, collision resolution, and related problems.
- `Heaps/`: Min-heaps, max-heaps, and heap-based algorithms.
- `Tries/`: Implementation and applications of trie data structures.
- I'll be also updating this as I go forward with my journey.
